## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, earthy green (#8F9779) reflecting the survival and crafting aspects of Vintage Story. It evokes a natural, aged feeling reminiscent of historical settings and resource gathering.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC). This provides a neutral backdrop, ensuring that the pixel art designs and schematic previews stand out clearly.
- Accent color: A desaturated orange-brown (#D2691E). Used to highlight interactive elements, this analogous color complements the primary green while referencing raw materials.
- Font: 'Literata' (serif) is ideal, conveying a sense of historical documentation in menus, titles and labels.
- A blocky, grid-based design reflecting the aesthetic of block-building games will ensure a playful nod to the game, while the information is well-organized and discoverable.
- Pixel-style icons complement the app's functionality (creation of schematics for the Vintage Story game)
